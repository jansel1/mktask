MkTask - Make Batch scripts with syntax highlighting.
How to debug:

If you are using a command like 'pause', it *will* crash MkTask, not sure why! Also, some commands like 'del', if used
on a folder, will also crash. Stick to 'rmdir'! 

For now, you will be limited to the MkTask output - but soon it will automatically open the default windows terminal.
